# TicketMaster

It was developed in my 5th semester. A Ticket Booking App is 
a digital platform that enables users to book tickets for various 
services and events, such as transportation or travel. It 
provides a user-friendly interface and backend functionalities 
to streamline the booking process, handle payments, and 
manage reservations efficiently.
